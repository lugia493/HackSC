Inspiration
I was on a trip to Lake Tahoe and my friends and I were taking pictures of each other and documenting our holiday. After the trip I had to ask all 6 of my friends to send me pictures of myself. The photos were scattered across 7 different phones and it was a hassle to sort through and upload all the photos to Google Drive or iCloud. With approximately 1.8 billion photos being taken everyday and people travelling more frequently, there was a need for a better to share those moments.

-- Thus, Tryp was born.

What it does
Tryp enables users to succinctly collate all the details of a trip - photos, friends you travelled with, itinerary notes etc on a Tryp 'card'. All photos that are taken are automatically uploaded to Tryp and shared with buddies on your Tryp 'card'. The user can then pick and choose what content they want to store, curate a Tryp 'card' which can be posted on Facebook and shared with all your other friends; creating a simple and powerful way to connect with others.

How we built it
We built the app on iOS on Xcode using Swift.
Facebook authentication was used for login, creating user profiles, adding friends to Tryp 'cards' etc
Firebase was used for the real time data storage
Photoshop and Illustrator were used for the design & UI/UX
Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges with trying to import user data & friends lists as well as trying to have the app make a curated post directly to Facebook.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of our concept and believe strongly in the other features we hope to implement in Tryp's future.
We also are proud of our sleek design and effective UI/UX
What we learned
We learned more about mobile application development in iOS, and how to integrate the app with Firebase

##What's next for Tryp
Monetizing Tryp by integrating ads on to interspersed travel 'cards'
Increasing Facebook utility: adding & posting pictures/posts to Facebook
Utilizing facial recognition to auto tag/filter photos
Streamlining how we manage photos
